By analyzing historical and recent satellite imagery, this tool tracks the rapid expansion of legal and illegal mining in the world's largest rainforest. This platform provides journalists, activists, researchers, and policymakers with the pan-Amazonian data needed to understand the drivers and impacts of gold mining and drive actions to stop it.",
