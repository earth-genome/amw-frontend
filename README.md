## Amazon Mining Watch

This is the frontend to Amazon Mining Watch built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/). It uses Next's native i18n support and App Router. As Next's language handling is still in flux at time of writing, it uses some custom middlewear and a cookie to persist the user's locale.
