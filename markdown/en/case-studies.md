# Case Studies

This work grew out of a series of collaborations with journalists and with activists seeking to expose illegal gold-mining activity and document its impacts on the environment and on local Indigenous communities.

A full [archive](https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector#journalism) is on Github.

If you are a journalist and want to investigate some of the areas of mining identified by this tool, we recommend you check on the geographical coordinates of the mines as provided in our interactive map. The location data will help you to cross-reference the information with other databases, such as deforestation or mining concessions. By correlating these datasets, you might be able to find the corporate actors responsible for the mining sites and determine the legality of the operations.
