# Data and Code

## Running the Code

This repository contains all code needed to generate data, train models, and deploy a model to predict the presence of mining in a region of interest. While we welcome external development and use of the code, subject to terms of an open [MIT license](https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector/blob/eboyda-patch-1/LICENSE), creating datasets and deploying the model currently requires access to the [Descartes Labs](https://descarteslabs.com/) platform.
