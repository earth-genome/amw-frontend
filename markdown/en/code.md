# Data and Code

The GitHub repository contains all code needed to generate data, train models, and deploy a model to predict the presence of mining in a region of interest. We welcome external development and use of the code, subject to terms of an open [MIT license](https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector/blob/main/LICENSE).

In April, 2025, we switched to present cumulative detections of mining activity on this website, starting from year 2018. 

Yearly assessments of mining in the Amazon basin remain available on our GitHub page. [Both are in GeoJSON format](https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector#results).
